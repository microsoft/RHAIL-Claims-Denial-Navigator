**What is the Rural Health AI Lab?**

The Rural Health AI Lab (RHAIL) is an initiative launched by Microsoft to collaborate with rural health leaders in developing innovative AI solutions to address the unique challenges of rural healthcare providers. The primary goals of RHAIL are to drive technological advancement, improve financial performance, and address rural health disparities

RHAIL focuses on creating affordable and accessible AI tools built using "Low Code/No Code" platforms, making them easy to implement and use. These tools are designed based on use cases identified and framed by the voice of the customer, ensuring they address real-world needs and challenges.

**What is Claims Denial Navigator?**

The Claims Denials Navigator is a free tool to help hospitals and other healthcare providers more quickly resolve denied insurance claims. The AI model uses “835” file information, claims payment guides and organization-specific polices and documentation to generate tailored recommendations for resolving a denied insurance claim. The billing specialist can then review and act on the appropriate recommendation(s) in the EHR/claims management system. Note: Version 1.0 of the Claims Denials Navigator is tailored to Medicare and Medicaid claims, as they represent a significant portion of all denied claims.

Behind the scenes, Claims Denials Navigator is a Model Driven Power App. Users upload their 835 text files to SharePoint, where the claim is parsed, processed by Azure OpenAI, and then one or more recommendations are generated.

View a brief demo of the Claims Denial Navigator tool [HERE.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzbVEpWZtL-XgFg_Un_EZARFmjEzWjcxp)

**How can Claims Denial Navigator help me?**

Claims Denial Navigator provides detailed explanations and definitions for Claim Adjustment Reason Codes (CARC) and Remittance Advice Remark Codes (RARC), making it easier for users to understand why a claim was denied. Additionally, the app customizes recommendations based on specific documents and feedback uploaded by the user. By leveraging Azure OpenAI, Claims Denial Navigator processes each claim uniquely, ensuring recommendations are tailored to the user's individual needs. This customization allows users to manage their own instance of Claims Denial Navigator, adjusting the settings and recommendations to best suit their specific requirements.

The Claims Denials Navigator can be used as a training tool for new billing staff.

**Is Claims Denial Navigator available on all devices?**

Claims Copilot is designed for use on desktop computers.

**Does the Claims Denial Navigator require EHR integration?**

The Claims Denials Navigator is a standalone application that does not require EHR integration. It can be used in parallel with your EHR/billing system to efficiently address denied claims that require additional investigation to resolve.

## **COST**

**Is this truly free for rural hospitals? What would be any added cost moving forward?**

The Claims Denial Navigator is _free for any provider that uses 835s/837s regardless of geography or for profit/nonprofit status_.

The hospital or provider entity needs three underlying technologies/capabilities:

1. SharePoint, which is part of the standard M365 license
2. Azure/Azure use – this depends on your usage and the size of the files uploaded. The larger the files, the larger the cost. For an organization with 2,000 Medicare and Medicaid claims with a denial rate of 15%, and a resubmit rate of 80% (the national average is 35%) we estimate the cost will be $100 - $150 per month in Azure computing power.
    - Independent CAHs and REHs that take advantage of MS Nonprofit pricing receive $2,000 in free azure credits annually that can be applied/cover the cost
3. PowerApps licenses – the number needed depends on the number of users (range from 4 – 8) for our early adopter sites. For a nonprofit eligible site needing 6 licenses, the cost would be $180/year.
    - **_Commerical Pricing_** – PowerApps Premium is priced at $20.00 per user per month, paid annually. This includes unlimited apps and Power Pages for the assigned user, along with 500 AI Builder credits, Dataverse entitlements (250 MB database, 2 GB file storage), and access to prebuilt/custom connectors. There is also a volume discount option available at $12.00 per user per month, paid annually, with a minimum of 2,000 licenses.
    - **_Nonprofit Pricing_** – PowerApps Premium is offered at a significantly reduced rate of $2.50 per user per month, paid annually. This nonprofit pricing includes the same features as the commercial version and is available only to eligible nonprofit organizations through Microsoft’s nonprofit program.

**Baseline Tech Requirements**

PowerApps runs in the cloud. All that is required is a modern computer and OS. You can use browsers like Edge or Chrome to access and use the Claims Denial Navigator. All supported browsers and operating systems are listed here <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/limits-and-config>.

**Are there any tutorials or guides for beginners?**

Yes, click the link [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzbVEpWZtL-XgFg_Un_EZARFmjEzWjcxp) to access all tutorials/guides.

## **Using Claims Denial Navigator**

**How do I upload a claim?**

Simply upload a claim to your chosen SharePoint site/folder. Once the file is uploaded, the process kicks off.

**Can I automate the uploading process?**

Yes, you can automate the uploading of files to SharePoint via Power Automate or PowerShell. The more files that you upload, the higher your consumption and cost. It is recommended that users upload a few (i.e., 3-5) 835 files manually and monitor the costs before implementing automation.

**How do I update or edit a claim?**

Users have the capability to provide feedback on each claim and modify the queue status. Modifications to the parse claim information and recommendations can only be made by admin users.

**Can the Claims Denial Navigator be used for Medicare Advantage plans?**

Yes. Users have the capability to upload Medicare Advantage documentation to the Storage Account and subsequently re-run the indexes to ensure inclusion.

## **Security and Privacy**

**How is my data protected?**

All resources and data reside within your organization’s Azure tenant, ensuring you have full control over access permissions.

**What information is sent to the Azure Open AI Model?**

The Azure Open AI Model is employed for two primary processes: parsing and recommendation. In the parsing process, the 835 text is transmitted to the model to extract pertinent information such as patient ID, claim ID, patient name, CARC codes, and RARC codes. In the recommendation process, the parsed CARC and RARC codes are utilized. No information leaves the organization.

**My 835 files are sitting on a SharePoint site. How are they protected?**

The SharePoint site is fully in your control, allowing you to manage access. Additionally, you can delete or archive files using Power Automate automation.

## **Additions and Customization**

**Can I use the data from the app for my own analysis?**

Yes. Although the solution does not include a standard dashboard or reporting, it is possible to connect your data to your preferred analysis method. For example, you can link the Dataverse tables to a Power BI report to create a customized dashboard or run a weekly data extract in an Excel file to be sent via email to users. The options are numerous.
