# Support

Thank you for using this project!

This repository is intended as a starting point for developers. It provides a base structure to help you begin coding quickly, but it is not actively maintained, and support will not be provided through GitHub.
We do not offer assistance for issues or questions related to this base. However, you're welcome to explore, modify, and build upon it as needed.
While we wonâ€™t be responding to GitHub issues or questions, the broader developer community is often generous with their time and may be able to help if you share your questions elsewhere (e.g., Stack Overflow, forums, or Discord groups).

## Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do **not** submit it via GitHub Issues. Instead, contact us directly through the appropriate security disclosure process.

Thank you for helping improve the project!
